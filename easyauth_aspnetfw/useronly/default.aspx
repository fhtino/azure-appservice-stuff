    Midway upon the journey of our life
    <br />
    I found myself within a forest dark,
    <br />
    For the straightforward pathway had been lost.
    <br />
    <br />
    Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say
    <br />
    What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,
    <br />
    Which in the very thought renews the fear.
    <br />
